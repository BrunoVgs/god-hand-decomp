/* include/godhand/FileLoadRec.h - FileLoadRec, one object file load in flight.
 *
 * A record is started with an object id: it converts the id (func_003078E0),
 * builds the file name (FileNameFromObjId) and asks cDvd_ReadAlloc to read the
 * file into a buffer it allocates. `handle` is what cDvd_ReadAlloc returned and
 * `data` receives the buffer. The record is at least 0x24 bytes.
 *
 * Field names are ours, taken from the functions that read and write them.
 * Offsets are exact. A field we can't name yet stays as unkNN padding.
