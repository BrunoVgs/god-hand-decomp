/* include/godhand/classFADE.h - classFADE, the screen fade.
 *
 * One fade object lives at D_00747470. start begins a fade between two
 * colours over a number of frames, status reports where it is (the state
 * byte at 0x1C), kill stops it and setOt chooses the ordering table
 * range it draws into.
 *
 * Method names are the game's own, from the symbol table in the retail ELF.
 * Field names are ours, taken from the methods that read and write them.
 * Offsets are exact: every body that uses this header builds byte-identical
 * to retail. A field we can't name yet stays as unkNNN padding.
